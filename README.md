## üìö Getting Started

### Start the server

Superviseur uses a server-client architecture. The server is responsible for managing the processes, while the client is responsible for communicating with the server.

```bash
superviseur serve
```

### Initialize a new project

```bash
superviseur new
```

Start by initializing a new project. This will create a `Superfile.hcl` file in the current directory with the following contents:

```hcl
project = "demo"
services = [
  {
    "name" = "demo"
    "type" = "exec"
    "command" = "ping $GITHUB_DOMAIN"
    "working_dir" = "/tmp"
    "description" = "Ping Service Example"
    "depends_on" = []
    "env" = {
      "GITHUB_DOMAIN" = "github.com"
    }
    "autostart" = true
    "autorestart" = false
    "namespace" = "demo_namespace"
    "port" = 5060
    "stdout" = "/tmp/demo-stdout.log"
    "stderr" = "/tmp/demo-stderr.log"
  }
]
```

### Start the service

```bash
superviseur start demo
```

Start the service by running the `start` command.

### Check the status

```bash
superviseur status demo
```
Output:
```
